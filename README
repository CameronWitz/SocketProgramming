I completed the entire assignment myself, and used the Beej's Guide as a base.
The files I have for this assignment are as follows:

Makefile - use to create the executables and .o files. This makefile supports all the required commands listed.

client.cpp - this file contains the client code. The client connects to the server over tcp, and supports the functionality to have queries input
through stdin.

servermain.cpp - this is the code for the server. It first reads in the list.txt information and creates some useful datastructures, and then it
will accept connections from clients. It is set to go on port 23659

The messages I exchange are very simple. All requests are taken as they come and it is assumed the request is read as a department name.
Responses from the server will be either the server associated with the department, or "Not found". The client checks to see if it is not found
and acts accordingly.

Reused code/Outside sources:

The entire baseline for both client and serverman.cpp are from Beej's tutorial provided in the pdf of the assignment.
As there is so much code that was used from this tutorial, I think it might be easier for me to just list the parts that I did completely on my own which are
as follows:

Again THIS IS THE CODE THAT I DID. The rest was used from the guide.

in servermain.cpp:

- readList function
- lines 112-113
- lines 122-126
- lines 180-241

in client.cpp:

- line 48
- line 75
- lines 80-1fa-rotate-180
